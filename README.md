# Tableau_Project
Developed interactive dashboards and charts to uncover patterns, compare key biomarkers, and support early detection efforts in clinical decision-making.
This project presents a detailed visual and analytical exploration of biomarker data from Sepsis and Non-Sepsis patients, created as part of my data visualization learning journey. Using Tableau, I developed interactive dashboards and charts to uncover patterns, compare key biomarkers, and support early detection efforts in clinical decision-making.
Project Overview:
Objective: To analyze biomarker differences between Sepsis and Non-Sepsis patients and gain insights into potential indicators of Sepsis onset.
Data Source: Biomarker dataset consisting of clinical measurements from both patient groups.
Tool Used: Tableau (for visualization) and Excel/CSV
Key Visuals:
Comparison of biomarker distributions (e.g. Heart Rate, PaCO2, Temperature, Lactate, WBC etc.)
Heatmaps, dendrograms, lollipop, radial charts and more.
Patient category breakdown by demographics and biomarker levels
Interactive filters for exploring Sepsis severity levels
Analysis Highlights:
Identified biomarkers significantly elevated in Sepsis patients
Visualized trends to support early-stage detection
Highlighted anomalies and outliers for clinical attention
Provided insights that could aid in risk stratification
This project demonstrates my ability to transform raw clinical data into meaningful visual stories using Tableau and provides a practical example of how data can support healthcare outcomes.
